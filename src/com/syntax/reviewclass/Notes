Class: A class is a blueprint to create an object. An object can not be created without a class.

a. Attributes: We define attributes by using variables
b. Behaviour: We define behavior by using methods.

Lets take for instance a Phone class. The attributes will include Colour, Size, models. While the behavior that is, what we can do with them will include; MakeCall, Listen to Music, Text, Download etc
For the phone class, i can create objects and objects can be as many as possible.
To create objects the key word "new" is used.


              THE STRING CLASS
A String is a class hence, it has its own attributes and behaviours. To define objects for a string, we use methods. The sting class has a of Methods
String is a combination of different characters. It is wrapped in double quotes. It can have spaces, numbers or special characters
String datatype is written with the uppercase unlike other data types that begin with lower cases
String is the most widely used class in java. It helps us store and manipulate Text based data.
Strings are immutable. This means their values can not be changed. Everytime we change their value or perform any kind of operation that may induce change on them,
a new string is created in the memory where this change is stored

              Why we should learn about String class and its methods:
String class has a lot of methods that can help us manipulate the text based data. That why we don't need to write any logic we can simply create the
object of the String class and can use the method from that class.
                      Syntax:
String str=new String("I can't sleep if i don't solve Repls");
String str2="I can't sleep if i don't solve Repls";
str2.length();

            METHOD
A method is a code that does a specific task. Methods have parenthesis
so string method is just code that does a specific task to my code.
To access a string method, just add a dot to your String.
